<meta name="description" content="I’ve been wanting to create my own website for a long time, but never really committed to making one until recently. Since I had no former experience with web development, I had to start from the very beginning - from researching which stack to use all the way to web hosting and deployment.

Here is why.My criteria for a website was simple: it should be 1) relatively quick to build and 2) gives me full customization capability. I’ve used various CMS in the past such as weebly/blogspot/wix, but I’ve found that those aren’t as flexible in customization as compared to building my own website. I also had to decide whether it would be a static website or a dynamic one as each would have very different tech stacks. Because my site would mainly be used for blogging and occasionally photo sharing, a static website would be more suitable as it is more light-weight than a dynamic one. It’s also worth to note that I did not need something that is only available in a dynamic website, such as a database or a login page. Then it came down to choosing a static site generator, since writing everything in raw HTML isn’t the most exciting thing, and managing all the asset files would be a pain. Initially, I heard about Jekyll through a friend of mine when he showed me his website that he was working on at the time.
