  title: "About Me"
  excerpt: "I am a software developer at Electronic Arts where I help make systems that power online gameplay capabilities. I graduated from the University of British Columbia where I obtained a BSc. with a Major in Computer Science. During my schooling, I also had former co-op experience working at Tasktop Technologies Inc, Capcom Vancouver, and NTT Research Lab.<br/><br/>I love uncovering new challenges and finding solutions to them, and so in my spare time I enjoy learning new technology and documenting my process. When I am not coding, I usually play sports like volleyball or ultimate, read books or play video games."
