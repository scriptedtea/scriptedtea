  excerpt: "I am a software developer who is passionate about coding and teaching others how to code.<br/><br/>I enjoy making things for learning or just for my own amusement. This blog originally started as a learning opportunity for myself, but I hope it can become a place for knowledge sharing. My posts can range from coding tutorials to random ideas that come to mind. When I am not coding, I like to go on photo walks, read books and play video games.<br/><br/>For inquiries, I can be reached at scriptedtea at gmail dot com"
