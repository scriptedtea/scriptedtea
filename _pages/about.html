  title: "About Me"
  excerpt: "I am a software developer at Electronic Arts where I help make systems that power online gameplay capabilities. I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BSc. Major in Computer Science.<br/><br/>Coding is my passion ever since falling in love with it during my high school age. I love seeking new challenges and getting the satisfaction of overcoming them. I started this blog to not only share my learnings but also to express any ideas that comes to mind. As an avid tea-drinker, I believe that coding and tea are a match(a) made in heaven. When I am not coding, I like to play sports like volleyball or ultimate, go on photo walks, read books or play video games."
