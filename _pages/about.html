  title: "About Me"
  excerpt: "I am a software developer at Electronic Arts where I help make systems that power online gameplay capabilities.<br/><br/>Coding has been my passion ever since falling in love with it during high school. I enjoy seeking new challenges and getting the satisfaction of overcoming them. As a lifelong learner, I am often trying new things such as learning a new language or a tool. My areas of interest include (but not limited to): distributed systems, games, web application and mobile application development.<br/><br/>This blog originally started as a project to get myself into web development, but it can be so much more. My posts can range from coding tutorials to random ideas that come to mind. When I am not coding, I like to play volleyball, go on photo walks, read books and play video games."
