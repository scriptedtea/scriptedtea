  title: "About Me"
  excerpt: "I am a software developer at Electronic Arts where I help make systems that power online gameplay capabilities.<br/><br/>Coding is my passion ever since falling in love with it during my high school age. I enjoy seeking new challenges and getting the satisfaction of overcoming them. As a lifelong learner, I am often trying new things such as learning a new language or a tool.<br/><br/>This blog originally started as a project to get myself into web development, but it can be so much more. My posts can range from summary of my learnings to random ideas that come to mind. When I am not coding, I like to play sports like volleyball or ultimate, go on photo walks, read books or play video games."
