  title: "About Me"
  excerpt: "I am a software developer who is passionate about coding and likes to share my knowledge to the world.<br/><br/>I enjoy seeking new challenges and getting the satisfaction of overcoming them. As a lifelong learner, I am often trying new things such as learning a new language or a tool. My areas of interest include (but not limited to): distributed systems, games, web app and mobile app development.<br/><br/>This blog originally started as a learning opportunity for myself, but I hope it can become a place for knowledge sharing. My posts can range from coding tutorials to random ideas that come to mind. When I am not coding, I like to play volleyball, go on photo walks, read books and play video games.<br/><br/>You can email me at scriptedtea at gmail dot com"
