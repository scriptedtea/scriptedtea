description: "Happy People is a 2D infinite side-scrolling game where player gets to control an arrow that has the power to give happiness to unhappy people (represented by purple faces). The goal is to survive as long as possible before the heart meter becomes empty. The meter automatically depleats as time progresses, but hitting gloomy people replenishes it. However avoid the angry people as they will decrease the heart meter even more! <br><br> This was my first game jam project where we finished the game in under 48 hours, and while it felt stressful at the time, I learned a lot about game development so it was overall a very good experience for me!"
