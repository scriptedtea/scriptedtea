description: "I implemented linear blend skinning algorithm to animate a 3D bear as part of a class project with another team member. We first created the mesh and a bone structure using Blender, then used OpenGL/C++ to animate the skin. We also suggested some methods to improve the algorithm in order to produce a more desired effect. <br><br> Watch the demo video below!"
