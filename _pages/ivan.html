description: "Me and 3 other team members developed a distributed, fault-tolerant voting system that collects votes from clients for an action and broadcasts the most voted action in real time. (A spinoff of the popular Twitch Plays Pokemon) This was demonstrated using a simple maze-like game where players submit votes to move towards the exit. I primarily worked on the client backend that interacts with the server via RPC. Both the client backend and server code were written in Go, while the game client was implemented in PHP."
