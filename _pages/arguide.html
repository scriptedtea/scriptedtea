description: "Anirevo Guide is the official mobile application for the Anime Revolution convention. It displays the 3-day convention schedules with guest bios, allows easy navigation and features bookmarking and reminder notifications. It is powered by Flutter, a cross-platform framework that allows native compilation into Android and iOS using a single codebase written in Dart. You can download the app on the app store using the links on the right. <br><br> Me and another dev worked on this app from scratch where I mainly worked on the page layouts, state management, google map integration, and push notifications. We are all volunteers for the convention and in early 2019, while we were planning for the Summer 2019 convention, one of the staff mentioned to make a mobile app. That was also the time I heard about Flutter for the first time, so we decided to work on a prototype to see how feasible it is. The project started around February 2019, and we released our beta by July in preparation for our early August launch. The app was downloaded over 2000 times collectively in the respective app stores, and we received positive receptions on the app. <br><br> Overall, I really enjoyed learning and working in Flutter. Dart was very easy to learn as it was very similar to Java, and so the majority of the learning curve came from understanding the Flutter widget tree and the UI components. We also tested with iOS/Android devices to ensure that the respective platorms had the smoothest experience, and it gave me a chance to learn about the mobile dev lifecycle. I hope to continue to develop more Flutter apps in the future."
