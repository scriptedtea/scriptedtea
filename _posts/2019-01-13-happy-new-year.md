Happy New Year! I was on a plane when the clock striked past midnight while coming back on my trip from China. My 2-week vacation went by in a blur, and the next thing I knew I was already back to work. Unfortunately I caught a stomach flu nearing the tail end of my trip so I took a day off to recover. I found that drinking some Chinese medicine really helped with re-gaining my appetite, and after 2 weeks of treatment I was finally able to eat normally.

As with most people, I plan on setting some goals for myself this year, but unlike a typical New Years Resolution - goals that you need to stick with for an entire year - it's much more feasible to set quarterly goals, then review your progress at the end of every quarter. As you already can see, I am currently working on my personal blog/site. What I love about working on this is that not only do I get to code but I also get to make various design choices and get a chance to create my own content. However that also came with its own set of challenges, mostly because it's my first time going full deep-dive into web development using HTML/CSS/Jekyll/Liquid. I am hoping to finish by the end of the first quarter, but we will see how that goes. I will be writing posts while building the site so there are some content when I launch the site. Can't wait to see the finished product!

Hoping to have updates to the site very soon!
