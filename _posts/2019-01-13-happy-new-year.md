Happy New Year! I was on a plane when the clock passed midnight while coming back from my vacation in China. My 2-week trip went by in a blur, and shortly I was back to work. Unfortunately I caught a stomach flu during my trip coming back so I took a day off and my overall energy was quite low. Drinking some Chinese medicine has helped me and slowly I am starting to get back to normal.

As with most people, I am setting some goals for myself this year, but unlike a typical New Years Resolution where you set something for a year, it's much more feasible to set quarterly goals, then review progress at the end of every quarter. As most of you see, I am currently working on my personal blog/site. I am hoping to finish by the end of the first quarter (end of March). I will be writing posts even before it finishes since building the site doesn't obstruct the blogging part. I look forward in seeing the finished product!

Hoping to have updates to the site very soon!
