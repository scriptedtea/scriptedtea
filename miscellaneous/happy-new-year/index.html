<meta name="description" content="Happy New Year! I was on a plane when the clock striked past midnight while coming back on my trip from China. My 2 week vacation went by in a blur, and the next thing I knew I was already back to work. Unfortunately I caught a flu nearing the tail end of my trip so I took a day off to recover. I found that drinking some Chinese medicine really helped with re-gaining my appetite, and after 2 weeks I was finally able to eat normally.As with most people, I plan on setting some goals for myself this year, but unlike a typical New Years Resolution - goals that you need to stick with for an entire year - it’s much more feasible to set quarterly goals, then review your progress at the end of every quarter. As you already can see, I am currently working on my personal blog/site. What I love about working on this is that not only do I get to code but I also get to make various design choices and be able to create my own content. On the other hand that also came with its own set of challenges, mostly because it’s my first time going full deep-dive into web development using HTML/CSS/Jekyll/Liquid. I am hoping to finish by the end of the first quarter, but we will see how that goes. I will be writing posts while building the site so there are some content when I launch the site. Can’t wait to see the finished product!Hoping to have updates to the site very soon!">
