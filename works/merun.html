              ME Run is a 2D infinite side-scrolling game where player must jump from building to building and avoid incoming obstacles. I developed this with another team member where I implemented jump and slide mechanic using C# scriping and also character animation. As this was designed for mobile platforms, player can jump by tapping anywhere on the screen, and tapping the slide button triggers the slide mechanic.
